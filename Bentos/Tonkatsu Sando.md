## Tonkatsu Sando (Crispy Pork Cutlet Sandwich)

At its core, the Tonkatsu Sando is a beautifully crafted sandwich comprising a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet snugly nestled between two slices of pillowy, soft, crustless bread. Its simplicity might mislead one into thinking it’s just another sandwich, but therein lies its magic – the symphony of flavors and textures that dance together with each bite.

### Materials

- 2 Pork Chops
- 1 Eggs
- ¼ cup [Flour](https://amzn.to/3GCiyBt)
- ⅛ cup Cold Water
- Salt and Pepper
- 2 cups Panko
- 4 slices [Homemade Milk Bread](https://tiffycooks.com/milk-bread-extra-fluffy-no-machine-needed/) link
- ½ cup shredded cabbage

#### Tonkatsu Sauce

- 2 tbsp [Soy Sauce](https://amzn.to/3elXf9P)
- 2 tbsp Ketchup
- 3 tbsp [Worcestershire Sauce](https://amzn.to/30eming)
- 1 tbsp [Roasted Sesame Seeds](https://amzn.to/3ITuUFT) grounded
- 1.5 tbsp Sugar

### Instructions

- Prepare the pork chop by cutting through the fat to prevent it from curling.
    
- Using the back of the knife, flatten the meat to help tenderize it. Using your palm, form the pork chop back to its shape—salt and pepper to season on both sides.
    
- In a bowl, mix flour, cold water, and two eggs till everything is combined. You want a thick but smooth consistency (refer to the video tutorial), and add more flour or water until the batter reaches the consistency.
    
- Generously coat the pork chop in the batter and then in panko. Make sure to pat it, so every part of the pork chop is coated in panko.
    
- In a pan, add in oil; once the oil is hot (test by adding in a piece of panko; it floats within 5 seconds, it is ready), add in the pork chop.
    
- Fry for 4-5 minutes on each side or until crispy and golden brown. Remove and let it rest on a paper towel.
    
- To make the sauce, mix soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, ketchup, and freshly roasted sesame seeds.
    
- To assemble, start with a slice of milk bread, topped with shredded cabbage, crispy pork cutlet, and tonkatsu sauce, and enjoy!
