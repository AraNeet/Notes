### Beef Teriyaki Bento Recipe

Teriyaki is a cooking technique that Japanese chefs first made during the 17th century and many other dishes that incorporated the same flavour. “Teriyaki” the word is a combination of two words, “teri”, means lustre and “yaki” means to grill. Characterised by their glistening visual appearance ingredients were traditionally grilled after being marinated in the sauce which consisted of miring, soy sauce, mirin and a type of sugar.

### Ingredients

- 2 beef steaks
- 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 2 tablespoons sake
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce

### Pre-Cooking Tip

A quick sear of the beef on both sides gives it a little colour and the steak will finish cooking while the teriyaki sauce reduces in the same pan.

### Variations

You can choose to use other ingredients such as ground beef, chicken or tofu.

> #### STEP 1 (COMBINE INGREDIENTS)
> 
> In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, mirin, soya saunce and sake in a bowl and stir the ingredients to combine. If your steak is lean rub a teaspoon of cooking oil onto each steak.
> 
> #### STEP 2 (SEAR STAKES)
> 
> Heat a wok over high heat until the bottom of the pan is hot and add the beef steaks, sear on both sides until browned.
> 
> #### STEP 3 (ADD SAUCE & SIMMER)
> 
> With the beef still in the pan pour in your teriyaki sauce and let it boil. Flip over the steaks repeatedly until the teriyaki sauce has reduced and each steak is in a thick shiny glaze.
> 
> #### STEP 3 (SLICE)
> 
> Let the beef steaks rest for a few minutes and transfer to a cutting board and slice with a sharp knife.
> 
> #### STEP 3 (REST & SERVE)
> 
> Pour any remaining sauce over the sliced steaks and garnish with chopped spring onion or sesame seeds. Let it rest for five minutes and serve.
