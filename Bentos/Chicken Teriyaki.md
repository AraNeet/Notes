Chicken Teriyaki is a beloved dish that effortlessly brings together the savory and sweet flavors of Japanese cuisine. A staple in many Japanese households, its versatility makes it a perfect choice for those preparing bento boxes. Whether you’re packing lunch for yourself or creating a meal for loved ones, this dish is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser. Its simplicity allows even beginners to prepare a delicious, balanced meal with ease. In this guide, you’ll learn how to make Chicken Teriyaki for bento boxes, along with tips on customising the recipe.

Chicken Teriyaki pairs wonderfully with a side of steamed rice, but it doesn’t stop there. Elevate your bento experience with accompaniments like cucumber salad, pickled vegetables, or even pre-cooked stir-fried veggies to add texture and flavor. Don’t forget the condiments—soy sauce, sesame seeds, or pickled ginger are great options for enhancing the overall flavor profile. The beauty of this recipe lies in its flexibility; whether you’re cooking for two or four people, it’s easy to adjust the quantities. Just be sure to give the chicken enough time to cook thoroughly. Now, let’s dive into the ingredients and steps needed to make your perfect Chicken Teriyaki.

### Ingredients for Chicken Teriyaki

To create this delicious dish, you’ll need the following ingredients:

- **1 tablespoon soy sauce**  
    Adds savory depth and saltiness to the sauce.
- **1 tablespoon mirin**  
    A sweet rice wine that balances the savory soy sauce with a touch of sweetness.
- **1 teaspoon sugar**  
    Enhances the caramelization of the sauce and gives the chicken a beautiful glossy finish.

- **4 ounces boneless chicken (breast, tenders, or thighs)**  
    Thighs are traditionally used for their tenderness and rich flavor, but you can also use breast or tenders based on your preference.
- **1/2 tablespoon cooking oil**  
    For pan-frying the chicken and helping to create a nice crust on the outside.
- **3 tablespoons water**  
    Helps to dilute the marinade for simmering.

### Instructions: How to Cook Chicken Teriyaki

To create a flavorful Chicken Teriyaki for your bento box, follow these simple steps. Marinate the chicken to infuse it with the perfect balance of savory soy sauce and sweet mirin, then pan-fry until golden brown. Simmer the chicken in the reserved marinade to form a delicious glaze, giving each bite a rich, glossy finish. Pair your Chicken Teriyaki with steamed rice, vegetables, and your favorite condiments for a well-rounded, tasty meal that’s easy to prepare.

#### Step 1: Marinate the Chicken

Start by preparing the marinade, which is key to infusing the chicken with deep flavors. In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Mix well, ensuring the sugar dissolves into the liquid. Cut the boneless chicken into bite-sized pieces—this not only helps the chicken absorb more marinade but also makes it easier to eat with chopsticks. Add the chicken to the marinade, turning to coat each piece thoroughly. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning halfway through. If you have more time, marinating for an hour or even overnight will significantly deepen the flavor.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Pan & Cook the Chicken

After marinating, heat 1/2 tablespoon of cooking oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. While the oil heats up, remove the chicken from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. Set aside the marinade as you’ll be using it later to create the teriyaki glaze.

Once the oil is hot, place the chicken pieces in the pan, ensuring each piece has direct contact with the pan’s surface. If you’re using chicken with skin, place the chicken skin-side down first. Cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side until the chicken is browned and has developed a golden crust.

#### Step 3: Simmer and Glaze the Chicken

Next, pour the reserved marinade into the pan along with 3 tablespoons of water. Cover the pan with a lid and lower the heat to a simmer. Let the chicken cook for about 5 minutes or until it’s fully cooked through. The marinade will slowly reduce into a rich, flavorful sauce.

Once the chicken is done, remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Allow the sauce to thicken and reduce, tossing the chicken in the sauce until each piece is fully coated with a sticky glaze. This final step of caramelization adds a beautiful shine to the chicken and locks in all the flavors.

#### Step 4: Serve and Enjoy

Your Chicken Teriyaki is now ready to be served! For a complete bento meal, pair it with steamed rice and add your choice of side dishes such as cucumber salad, pickled vegetables, or stir-fried greens. For extra flavor, garnish the chicken with sesame seeds, chopped scallions, or a side of pickled ginger. Enjoy your homemade Chicken Teriyaki as part of a satisfying and balanced bento box.

### Handy Tips for Cooking Chicken Teriyaki

- **Marinate Longer for Better Flavor**: Although 30 minutes is sufficient, allowing the chicken to marinate for an hour or overnight will significantly enhance the flavors. Marinating the chicken overnight in the refrigerator will provide a deeper, more intense taste.
- **Prepare Sides Ahead of Time**: Maximize your time by preparing sides like rice, cucumber salad, or pickled vegetables while the chicken is marinating. This will streamline your cooking process and ensure that your bento box comes together seamlessly.
- **Achieve the Perfect Glaze**: After the chicken is fully cooked, don’t skip the step of reducing the marinade. The thick, sticky glaze is what gives Chicken Teriyaki its signature finish. Be patient as the sauce thickens—it’s worth the wait for that beautiful glossy coating.
- **Try Different Proteins**: This recipe works well with beef, pork, or tofu. Tofu cooks more quickly, while beef and pork may require additional cooking time. Experiment with different proteins to find your favorite variation.
- **Meal Prep for Future Bento Boxes**: Make extra servings of Chicken Teriyaki to freeze for future meals. Store the cooked chicken in clip-lock bags or airtight containers and freeze for up to a month. Reheat as needed, and you’ll have a bento component ready to go for busy days.
