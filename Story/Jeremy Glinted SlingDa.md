## 🤝 ## **Potential Group Dynamics**

- **Ara Utsuro:**  
    Teases Ara constantly, trying to make him lose composure. Respects his genius, but never stops trolling.
    
- **Walker:**  
    Thinks Walker’s stoic aura is hilarious. Tries to annoy him, but can’t deny his power. Jokes aside, Jeremy backs Walker in a pinch.
    
- **Koji Kamazottsu:**  
    Loves Koji’s chaotic fire but competes for attention. They're either the best prank duo or the reason half a city’s missing.
    
- **Yuki Utsuro:**  
    She finds him exhausting. He finds her silence terrifying. He once asked her on a date mid-fight as a joke — never again.
    
- **Aqua Utsuro:**  
    Genuinely enjoys her company. They duet sometimes, with Jeremy doing dumb beatboxing and Aqua singing over it.
    
- **Flora Utsuro:**  
    Afraid of her quiet judgment. Cleans up after himself if she’s around. Once called her “mom” accidentally — never lives it down.
    
- **Trashie:**  
    Thinks Trashie is the weirdest powerhouse he’s ever met. Constantly tries to steal his “legendary stick” and gets bonked for it. Loves arguing with him about who’s more resourceful — Jeremy with his rubber body or Trashie with duct tape and backpack gear. Despite the bickering, Jeremy trusts Trashie with his life (and sometimes his snacks).
