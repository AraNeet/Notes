Trashie doesn’t have supernatural powers — he’s just a suburban man armed with frustration, homeowner pride, and survivalist YouTube knowledge.

## 🥊 **Combat Style – Improvised Street Guard**

Trashie fights like a survivalist who's seen _just enough_ online tutorials to be dangerous:

- **Shield-first** defense, using the lid to absorb and redirect attacks
    
- **Poke-n-run** with the sharp stick, aiming for weak points and joints
    
- **Creative improvisation** — once won a fight using only duct tape and a rake handle
    
- **Only draws the gun** when he's truly cornered (and complains the whole time)

## 🤝 **Potential Group Dynamics**

- **Ara Utsuro:** Thinks Ara is "a good, quiet kid" who just needs a job. Ara admires Trashie’s shield defense and never underestimates his resolve.
    
- **Walker:** Trashie finds Walker’s spirit blasts “very loud” and calls him “anime Ghost Rider.” Walker loves messing with him.
    
- **Koji Kamazottsu:** Trashie doesn’t trust him one bit. Keeps his hand near the concealed holster around Koji.
    
- **Yuki Utsuro:** He tries to dad-splain thermodynamics to her. She listens once, then never again.
    
- **Aqua Utsuro:** He offered her juice boxes and now she calls him “Uncle Trash.” He low-key loves it.
    
- **Flora Utsuro:** Trashie respects Flora’s responsibility and quiet strength. Secretly asks her for cleaning tips
