## 🤝 **Key Relationships**

### **Ara Utsuro:**

Genuinely enjoys Ara’s calm and calculated presence. Feels oddly safe around him and tries to make him laugh. Respects Ara’s intelligence and presence, often lingering near him during downtime or after missions.

### **Koji Kamazottsu:**

Loathes Koji’s chaotic and explosive nature. Thinks he’s immature and unbearable. Their encounters often devolve into shouting matches or destructive fights. Sees Koji as a liability, not a partner.

### **Yuki Utsuro:**

Uneasy around her — she sees through his antics. Finds her calm unnerving, especially when she doesn’t react to his jokes.

### **Aqua Utsuro:**

Teases her for being “too bubbly,” but secretly enjoys her singing. Will never admit he’s soft for her energy.
